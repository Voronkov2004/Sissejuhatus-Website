            <h2>Overview :</h2>
            <p>A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow
                 to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot. It requires immediate medical attention. Knowing the basic first aid steps can make 
                 a significant difference before professional help arrives.</p>
